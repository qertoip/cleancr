# cleancr

(this is initial version of the software and should not be used for any serious purposes)

Finds and optionally removes CR (carriage return) characters from your project text files.

Carriage return characters also known as \r or ^M are evil 
and should never happen to exist in your source code files.
However, when software is being developed on multiple operating systems, 
editors and IDEs, it is easy for unwanted CR characters 
to sneak into your project.

Use cleancr tool to monitor for CR chars and get rid of them 
from the whole project with one command.
